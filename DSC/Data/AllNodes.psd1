CYBERSECURITY WARNING: NO CREDENTIALS IN THIS FILE

This data file is committed to Git. NEVER put passwords, API keys, or secrets here.

ACCEPTABLE DATA (safe to commit):
- Domain names, server names, IP addresses
- Feature lists, role configurations
- Non-sensitive metadata (OU names, group names)
- Certificate thumbprints (public info, not the private key!)

NEVER COMMIT:
- Passwords (plaintext or "obfuscated")
- Connection strings with embedded credentials
- API keys, tokens, or access secrets
- Private keys or PFX files with passwords

WHY THIS MATTERS (Security Mindset):
1. Git History is Permanent: Even if you delete a secret later, it's in the commit history forever
2. Public Repos: Students often make repos public for portfolios - instant breach
3. Credential Scanners: GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket scan for secrets automatically
4. Professional Consequences: Companies fire employees for committing secrets (real incidents)

Real-world example (2021): Uber engineer committed AWS keys to GitHub.
Cost: $100k AWS bill before discovered, engineer terminated, company fined.

WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:
- Orchestrator (Run_BuildMain.ps1) handles credential creation securely
- Credentials passed at runtime, never stored in files
- Production: Use Azure KeyVault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault
- DSC supports certificate encryption for MOF files (we'll cover this later)

IF YOU NEED CREDENTIALS FOR TESTING:
- See Documentation\README.md for the fixed lab passwords
- Use them MANUALLY in PowerShell sessions ONLY
- NEVER put them in code or data files

This is not just a rule - this is professional survival.
